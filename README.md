# nestjs-config

### Convenient modular config for `nestjs` applications

1. Type casting (everything in `environment` is string) E.g. 'true' -> boolean ...
2. runtime validation
3. compatible with `typescript` you will have typed configs
4. modularity - you can define configs for every module in you project
5. get variables from environment variables by design
6. Convenient configs definition with `class-transformer/class-validator`
